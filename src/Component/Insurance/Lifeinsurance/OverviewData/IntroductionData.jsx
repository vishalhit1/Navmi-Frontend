            <h3 className='itro-sxssa'>Overview of Life Insurance</h3>
            <p className='joshi'>Life insurance is an agreement between the policyholder and the insurer, where the insurer commits to paying a specified beneficiary a sum of money upon the policyholder's death, in return for regular premium payments. This financial safeguard ensures that your family can maintain their lifestyle and cover future expenses even when you are no longer there.</p>
