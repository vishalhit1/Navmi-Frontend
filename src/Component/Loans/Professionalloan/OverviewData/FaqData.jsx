                        <Accordion.Body>
                            Most of the banks have pre-payment penalty. You might have to pay the pre-closure charges up to 3 - 5%. Few lenders do not charge you after a certain period.

                        <Accordion.Header>8. How Reducing Rate and Flat Rate is different?</Accordion.Header>
                        <Accordion.Body>
                            As the word justifies, Reducing Balance Interest Rate needs the borrower to pay interest only on the remaining principle balance, i.e. the balance that remains outstanding after getting reduced by the principal repayment. Flat Interest Rate is wherein the borrower needs to pay interest on the entire loan balance throughout the loan term. Thus, interest component does not decrease on paid principle. Interest remains flat in all the EMIs.
