            <p className='itro-sxssaaasxaa'>A construction loan is a short-term financing option that supplies funds for the construction of a home or other real estate projects. Unlike traditional mortgages, which offer a lump sum upfront for purchasing property, construction loans release funds in stages as the construction progresses. This approach ensures that borrowers have access to the necessary capital at each phase of their project.</p>
