                            <h2>Application Process</h2>
                            <p>To obtain a construction loan, borrowers need to submit detailed plans and budgets for their project. Lenders usually require a minimum down payment (typically around 20-25%) and may request documentation related to creditworthiness and project viability.</p>

                    </Col>

                        <div className="choose-box">
                            <h2>Approval and Draw Schedule</h2>
                            <p>After approval, lenders create a draw schedule that corresponds with project milestones. Funds are disbursed once itâ€™s confirmed that each stage has been completed satisfactorily.</p>

                    </Col>

                            <h2>Construction Phase</h2>
                            <p>Throughout construction, borrowers only pay interest on the amounts drawn until the project is fully completed.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h2>Completion and Transition</h2>
                            <p>After the construction, borrowers can refinance into a long-term mortgage or obtain an end loan to pay off the construction loan. </p>
